### _This project is still in the development phase_

Please see the roadmap for an indication of how far along development is for the current state.

# Academic-Website

This project aims to be a static site template for [Franklin.jl](https://github.com/tlienart/Franklin.jl), which hopefully can one day be added to [FranklinTemplates.jl](https://github.com/tlienart/FranklinTemplates.jl). The project will hopefully also become a package in the Julia general registry, so that existing websites using this template can easily update their sites as the template updates.

The focus for this template is websites for academics, and it was heavily inspired by the [AcademicPages](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io) template.
