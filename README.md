### _This project is still in the development phase_

Please see the roadmap for an indication of how far along development is for the current state.

# Academic-Website

This project aims to be a static site template for [Franklin.jl](https://github.com/tlienart/Franklin.jl), which hopefully can one day be added to [FranklinTemplates.jl](https://github.com/tlienart/FranklinTemplates.jl).

The focus for this template is websites for academics, and it was heavily inspired by the [AcademicPages](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io) template.
