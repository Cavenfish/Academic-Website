# Your Blog Posts

As academics we dive deep into niche things and share our 
findings in peer-reviewed papers. We also learn a lot of 
tricks, tools, and techniques that help us conduct our
research. These we often share through personal communications
with colleagues or mentees. 

Why not write short blog (you don't have to call it a blog)
posts sharing this knowledge with anyone that comes upon 
your website.
